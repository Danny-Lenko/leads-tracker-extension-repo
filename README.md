# Chrome Extension - Leads Tracker

### What I learned

1) the Utility Classes "gap" property to use between flex and grid elements (html customizable variable)

```css
.flex {
   display: flex;
   gap: var(--gap, 1.6rem);
}
.grid {
   display: grid;
   gap: var(--gap, 1.6rem);
}
```

### Continued development

* CSS grid;
